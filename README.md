**Simple Grafana dashboard for MyElectricalData**

Written for influxDB v2, with flux language. It needs you to configure a datasource in grafana pointing to your InfluxDB server. I named my datasource "InfluxDB2". Not sure if it's critical for the dashboard to work.

Does not use the PDL as variable in the queries, so removed that as a variable. It pulls all data in InfluxDB assuming a single PDL

The below is assuming you already have a data connection in Grafana to your influxDB database, and the proper plugins installed. If not, see at the bottom

To use, simply go to grafana, on the left pick Dashboard, Import, then select the JSON file

Give the dashboard a name and voil√†

**Installing the connection to InfluxDB**

You need to go to grafana settings -> administration -> data sources and add a data source. Pick influx as the engine.
Then fill the URL of the database, organization ID and token that you have generated in InfluxDB
